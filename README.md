Coding exercise

## Setup
1. Set up the Flask environment in `flask-api` with `pipenv install`
2. Activate the Pipenv shell with `pipenv shell`
3. Start up the Flask API in `flask-api` with `python app.py`
4. Set up the Node environment in `node-server` with `npm install`
5. Start up the Node server with `npm start`
6. Go to `localhost:3000` on the browser

## Note

I used a JSON file to persist data. I did not include my JSON file in this repository. When you start the Flask server for the first time, the app will create that file.
